#TODO

- Notifications shouldn't be created if the user to be notified is on the page that the notification is for (possible?)
    - Will probably have to track which page each user is on to do this - prob not worth it.
    - Are notifications even worth having ?
- Animations and related polishing stuff
    - need to animate routes but it seems no good way to do this yet 
- Replace dropdown used for notifications with a better library
    - could add growl style notifcations too
- Implement turns for writing chapters
    - each user should only be able to write one consecutive chapter per story
- Number chapters
- Add server-side error logging
